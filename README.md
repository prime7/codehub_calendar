**Coding Conventions**
Please make sure to add comments to any JS or Python code your write
Allways pull before you push
Before you push to master, make sure your feature is well tested and nothing is broken
Make sure your commits are all commented with meaningful messages
=> The convention for this is to make commits for each main change or feature you make. This keeps the history tidy, and when we look at the files editted, we'll know that these changes were made for this.
When you close a github issue, make sure to add the Commit hash to that issue's closing comment, to keep the history organized
